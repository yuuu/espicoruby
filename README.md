# espicoruby

This project runs [PicoRuby](https://github.com/picoruby/picoruby) on ESP32 and serves as an example of using [picoruby-esp32](https://github.com/yuuu/picoruby-esp32).  
Currently, **it has only been tested on the [M5Stamp C3 Mate](https://docs.m5stack.com/ja/core/stamp_c3).**

## Getting Started

### Preparation

Set up your development environment using ESP-IDF by referring to [this page](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.4/esp32/get-started/index.html#manual-installation).

### Setup

Run the following shell script to build PicoRuby:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/yuuu/espicoruby.git
```

### Build

Build the project using the `idf.py` command.

```sh
$ . $(YOUR_ESP_IDF_PATH)/export.sh
$ idf.py set-target $(YOUR_ESP_TARGET) # example: idf.py set-target esp32c3
$ idf.py build
```

### Flash and Monitor

Flash the firmware and monitor the output using the `idf.py` command. PicoRuby Shell will start.

```sh
$ idf.py flash
$ idf.py monitor
```
